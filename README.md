# Arch-Linux installation documentary

![Screenfetch Arch](/images/screenfetch_arch.png)

This will document my current Arch Linux installation with **SED** (self encrypted disk), **FDE** (full disk encryptyion, using dm-crypt and LUKS), **BTRFS** filesystem (with subvolumes for easy snapshotting and backup/restore) and **Secure Boot**.

It may then further grow into a ['r/unixporn'](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) repository with config-files needed to achieve the current flavor of my system,
mainly for myself, but most hopefully usefull to anyone else. 

This is intended to be a documentation of a nice-to-have paranoid setup. 
Everybody has to decide for himself which balance of comfort vs security he wants and needs. 

This might be more than I need for security (since I have few data that might be of high or even any interest to others), 
but this is what I am capable of and it is a kind of a 'because I can' installation.

Very few things are special in this installation and 98% are just adapted and copied from anywhere else on the net and from other wikis and documentations, so most credit goes to them, not me. 

I will try to link all used and usefull references to set up such a system and highly anticipate to not follow it as an
installation guide, but read it as another wiki to learn how to set up your own rig. 

Now [here](https://github.com/TheContortion1st/Arch-Linux-install-doc/wiki) you go to the Wiki and documentary.

Have fun reading!
